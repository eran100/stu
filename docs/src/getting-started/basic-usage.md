# Basic Usage

After [Installation](./installation.md), run the following command:

```
stu
```

Basically, you can use it in [the same way as the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

In other words, if the default profile settings exist or [the environment variables are set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html), you do not need to specify any options.

If you want to specify it using command line options, see [Command Line Options](./command-line-options.md).
